The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics
  2. Road definition
  3. Artificial sensors
  4. Collision detection
  5. Traffic simulation
  6. Neural network
  7. Visualizing neural networks
  8. Optimizing neural networks
  9. Fine-tuning
  10. Live stream variant
